      "page": 193,
      "answer": "The `reduce` function reduces the stream down to a single element.\n\n`T reduce(T identity, BinaryOperator<T> accumulator)`\n`identity` is the initial value, and `accumulator` defines how the elements will be merged.\n\n`Optional<T> reduce(BinaryOperator<T> accumulator)`\nSimilar to the previous, except the initial value can be omitted. This will return...:\n- An empty `Optional` when the stream is empty\n- The element, if the stream only contains one element\n- The accumulated value, if the stream has multiple elements.\n\n`<U> U reduce(U identity, BiFunction<U, ? super T, U> accumulator, BinaryOperator<U> combiner)`\nThis is useful in parallel streams as it allows the JVM to create intermediate combined elements, and then combine all of those at the end."

      "page": 195,
      "answer": "`<R> R collect(Supplier<R> supplier, BiConsumer<R, ? super T> accumulator, BiConsumer<R, R> combiner)`\n- The `supplier` provides the initial value. The `accumulator` specifies how the elements should be added to the supplied object. The `combiner` specifies how these objects should be combined. This is useful for parallel streams when combining the results from each thread.\n\n`<R,A> R collect(Collector<? super T, A, R> collector)`\n- Collects with a `Collector`."
